# E-Commerce-Shipping-Data-Analysis-Using-R

Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze an E-Commerce Shipping dataset to understand factors affecting delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. By exploring shipment delays, cost impacts, and customer ratings, this analysis provides insights that can help improve logistics and supply chain management.

Tools & Techniques Used
Programming Language: R
Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr
Dataset: E-Commerce Shipping Dataset (10,999 records, 12 features)
Key Techniques: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature transformation

Summary of Work Done
1. Data Import & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, converted data types, and formatted categorical variables for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated patterns in shipment delays, customer ratings, and cost variations using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3. Feature Engineering: Created new variables to better capture trends in delivery times and customer satisfaction.
4. Findings & Insights: Identified key factors influencing delays and developed recommendations for optimizing shipping efficiency.

E-commerce logistics is a critical area in retail and supply chain management. Understanding shipping patterns, delivery efficiency, and customer feedback helps businesses reduce delays, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize operations. This project applies data science techniques to real-world problems, making it relevant for industries focused on improving logistics performance.

Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and formatted columns.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Used summary statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations (histograms, box plots) to understand trends.
3. Feature Transformation: Encoded categorical variables and derived meaningful features for better interpretation.
4. Insights & Recommendations: Identified patterns in delivery delays and customer satisfaction to suggest improvements in logistics and resource allocation.

This project highlights how data-driven decision-making can enhance e-commerce shipping operations. By leveraging R for data analysis, we identified crucial factors affecting delivery delays and customer experience. The findings from this study can assist businesses in optimizing logistics, reducing operational inefficiencies, and improving overall service quality.
